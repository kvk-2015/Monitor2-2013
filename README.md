# Monitor2-2013
2013-12-07 partial "snapshot" of my pet project

Script Monitor2 collected voltage info from UPS Ippon Smart Winnner 750, managed ADSL modem,
updated DynDNS status, started and stopped VMware Player (where Apache http server with my Django home_site runed that time)
when BeholdTV tuner made recordings, and more...

home_site/ups_statistics showes the results of voltage monitoring

As a result settings of Volt control equipment were tuned: https://dzen.ru/a/YxoadV2THUlQT6EC
