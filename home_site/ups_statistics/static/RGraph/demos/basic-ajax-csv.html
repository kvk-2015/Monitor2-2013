    <h1>A basic example of AJAX and CSV data</h1>
    
    <p>
        This is a basic example of using CSV and AJAX. AJAX is used to request the data and it is returned in CSV format. The JSON
        data is then evaluated and a chart created using it.
    </p>

    <canvas id="cvs" width="600" height="250">[No canvas support]</canvas>

    <script>
        /**
        * Ths window.onload function initiates the AJAX request. The AJAX page is: http://www.rgraph.net/getdata.html
        * If you view this in your browser you'll see that all it does is output a sequence of numbers.
        */
        window.onload = function ()
        {
            RGraph.AJAX.getCSV('/getdata.html', drawGraph);
        }



        /**
        * This is the AJAX callback function. The AJAX getCSV() converts the strings to numbers for you.
        */
        function drawGraph (csv)
        {
            // Now draw the chart
            var line = new RGraph.Line('cvs', csv)
                .Set('hmargin',0)
                .Set('linewidth', 2)
                .Set('ymax', 100)
                .Set('numxticks', 9)
                .Set('labels', ['Gary','Rachel','Neil','Martha','Kevin','Craig','John','Peter','Luis','Bert'])
                .Draw();
        }
    </script>

        <b>Note:</b>
        In October 2013 a new CSV reader was added to RGraph. It makes reading CSV files much easier. You can read about
        <a href="http://www.rgraph.net/docs/csv-file-reader.html">the new CSV reader</a> here.
